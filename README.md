## Hello to my Github

### About me
I am currently affiliated with the [Institute for Consciousness and Dream-Research](https://traum.ac.at), where I can research sleep and dreaming and published some [findings and reviews](#selected-publications).
I have recently graduated with a Masters Degree in Psychology after finishing a Bachelors Degree in Psychology and a Bachelors Degree in Statistics and Data Analytics all at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at). 

### Interests
My interests vary widely, which is also exemplified by short-lived enrolments into Social and Cultural Anthropology as well as Astrology. I also (try) to play sports and sometimes even make music. <br>
Math has always come easily to me, so even though Psychology was my primary interest, I was quite fascinated by qualitative working and analysing data, which i persued during my studies whereever I could, which also led me to doing a Bachelor in Statistics and Data Analytics. At the same time I found an interest in Machine Learning, for which, surprisingly, both of my studies provided opportunities to further pursue. Well, for Statistics, it is probably not surprising, but more so for Psychology. I even had the opportunity to write my Master's Thesis on Permutation Feature Importance. <br>
If I ever come around to it, I will add some code from various projects on one or two repositories.
