## Hello to my Github

### About me
I am currently affiliated with the [Institute for Consciousness and Dream-Research](https://traum.ac.at), where I research sleep and dreaming. Some of my publications can be found [below](#selected-publications). Besides my interest for human behaviour and consciousness, I am passionate about Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. I persued this by writing a thesis for my Bachelors Degree in Statistics and Data Analytics about dating pinewood using support vector regression and a thesis for my Masters Degree in Psychology about Permutation Variable Importance in the presence of correlated predictor. Besides I try to regularly participate in competitions at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) for which I upload some code [here](https://github.com/sevabl/Kaggle-notebooks). Currently, I am learning about NLP and textmining, for which I will try to upload one or two projects.

### Further Interests
My interests vary widely, which is also exemplified by short-lived enrolments into Social and Cultural Anthropology as well as Astrology. I also (try) to play sports and sometimes even make music. <br>

While you are here, why not check out my new [notebook](https://github.com/sevabl/Feature-Importance/blob/main/Permutation%20Feature%20Importance%20-%20Bias%20in%20Correlated%20Predictors.ipynb) exploring why using Permutation Feature Importance in correlated predictor variables might not be a good idea!
